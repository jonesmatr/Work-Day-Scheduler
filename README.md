## Introduction
The Work Day Scheduler is a web application that allows you to schedule and organize your work day. It provides a user-friendly interface where you can input and save tasks for different hours of the day. The time blocks are color-coded to indicate past, present, and future time slots. This helps you easily identify and manage your tasks throughout the day.
